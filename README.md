# Predictive Modeling Using Skafos

## Introduction

The purpose of this example is to highlight the utility of Skafos, Metis Machine's data science operationalization and delivery platform. In this example, we will:

* Build and train a model predicting likelihood of international travel with data that is available on a public S3 bucket.
* Save this model using the Skafos data engine
* Score new customers using this model and save these scores.
* Access these scores and model metrics via an API.
